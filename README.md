# AutomatePythonProjects
A new command used to create python projects

This is my first ever project. I never coded anything before this and never did something similar.
this is very bad and will need some manual adjustments the first time you download it.

Requirements:
- selenium
- pathlib

How To Use:
- create a path to the folder in which you put these 2 files.
in createpythonproject.py:
- change the path (line 11 and 14) to whatever folder you want to store your projects in (in line 14, maintain + sys.argv[1])
- change the email to your github email(line 26)
- change the password to your github password (line 28)
- open cmd
- type createpy project_name
in createPY:
- change the path (line 1) to whatever folder you put the files in
- change the path (line 3) to wherever you wanna store the projects
- change the <username> (line 5) to your github's username
